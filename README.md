The AutoFuelShield is an innovative safety system designed to prevent deadly post-accident fuel tank explosions. In many road crashes, victims suffer not only from the collision but also from fire caused by leaking petrol or diesel. Traditional fire extinguishers are reactive and depend on human presence, whereas AutoFuelShield provides a proactive, automatic solution.

The system works by detecting collision-induced pressure using a sensor, which sends signals to an Arduino Uno. This triggers the servo motors that inject the Emulsifying agent mixture into the fuel tank. A DC motor then agitates the mixture, converting the fuel into a non-flammable emulsion, thus neutralizing the risk of fire within seconds.

Key highlights of AutoFuelShield include:

  Automatic prevention before fire breaks out in the fuel tank.

  Low-cost (~₹1000) and compact design, utilising simple electronics.

  Life-saving impact, especially in the golden seconds after a crash.

Potential for scalability with flame sensors, GSM alerts, IoT, and AI integration.

By offering an affordable and accessible solution, AutoFuelShield can significantly improve road safety in India, particularly for commercial vehicles and fuel tankers. This project demonstrates how automation, sensors, and fluid mechanics can be combined to save lives and reduce accident-related damage.

Conclusion:
AutoFuelShield is a pioneering step towards smarter and safer vehicles, ensuring proactive protection against fuel-induced fires and making roads safer for everyone.
